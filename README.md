# Coding-1-Final
There is a lot going on in the website but it should be easy to get a hang of once you look through it.
You can navigate through the Navbar at the top of each page.
In the Home page, there is a carousel of cats and after scrolling down, you can see their descriptions and learn about them.
The About Me page is just a quick, short description of me and what I like to do.
Finally, the Contact Me page is just some information you can use if needed to contact me and let me know of any problems or any additional information.
This website is also used for my Final in Coding I.
